		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>	I am currently a PhD student at Keele University, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/scm/staff/paultruman/">Dr. Paul Truman</a>. I did my MMath at the University of Exeter, my master's dissertation was on <i>Finite Abelian Extensions of the Rational Numbers</i> and was supervised by <a href="https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/people/profile/index.php?web_id=hj241">Dr. Henri Johnston</a>. During my time at Exeter I undertook an undergraduate research project, supervised by <a href="https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/people/profile/index.php?web_id=NPByott">Prof. Nigel Byott</a> and funded by an <a href="https://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/undergraduate-research-bursaries">LMS Undergraduate Research Bursary</a>, counting Hopf-Galois structures on separable extensions of particular degree.
		</p>
		<p> For the 2022/23 academic year, was also a Teaching Fellow at Keele. I lead the second year module Exploring Algebra and Analysis (<a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/catalogue/2022-23/mat-20035.htm">MAT-20035</a>) the third year module Number Theory and Cryptography (<a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/catalogue/2022-23/mat-30038.htm">MAT-30038</a>), as well as assisting in tutorials for the foundation year.</p>

		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<p> Broadly, I am interested in algebra with a group theory flavour. My current work is on the novel algebraic structure of the skew bracoid, which is a generalisation of the skew brace corresponding to Hopf-Galois structures on seperable but not necessarily normal extensions of fields. As with the skew brace, the skew bracoid is also connected to the study of solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. I am most excited when structural information can be passed through these various correspondences.
